## Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è

### Go

You can use Go to install LazyTest

```sh
go install github.com/kampanosg/lazytest@latest
```

### Brew

> [!WARNING]
> Brew is not yet available, I am working on it.

### Build from source

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need **Go v1.22** to build the project.

#### Makefile

You can build the project with `make`

```sh
make
```

An executable called `lazytest` will be built. You can move it to your `$PATH`

#### Bakery

If you're a [Bakery](https://github.com/kampanosg/bakery) fan (well, thank you!), LazyTest comes with a `Bakefile` that you can use with `bake`. You can just run

```sh
bake
```

An executable called `lazytest` will be built. You can move it to your `$PATH`

## Engines üèéÔ∏è

"Engines" are a core concept in LazyTest. It allows the tool to be extensible and work with many languages and test frameworks. When LazyTest parses the codebase, it uses the engines to determine if a given file contains tests. Engines also provide instructions on how to run a given test.

You can write a new Engine by implementing the following function

```go
type LazyEngine interface {
  ParseTestSuite(fp string) (*models.LazyTestSuite, error)
}
```

The `ParseTestSuite` expects a `filepath`. If it's a valid test file for the given language, then the engine should parse the file and return the `LazyTestSuite` which contains all the tests and instructions on how to run them. As an example, have a look at the Go engine:

### Available Engines

LazyTests comes packed with the following engines:

* Golang

### Upcoming Engines

The following engines are being built:

* Rust
* Python
* Zig
* Jest

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

### Use it with ToggleTerm

[ToggleTerm](https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim) is a popular NeoVim plugin that lets you "persist and toggle multiple terminals during an editing session". It can be used with LazyTest, to avoid context-switching when you have to run your tests.

You can add the following to your NeoVim config:

```lua
local Terminal  = require('toggleterm.terminal').Terminal

local lazytest = Terminal:new({
  cmd = "lazytest",
  dir = ".",
  direction = "float",
  float_opts = {
    border = "curved",
  },
  -- function to run on opening the terminal
  on_open = function(term)
    vim.cmd("startinsert!")
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(term.bufnr, "n", "q", "<cmd>close<CR>", {noremap = true, silent = true})
  end,
  -- function to run on closing the terminal
  on_close = function(term)
    vim.cmd("startinsert!")
  end,
})

function _lazytest_toggle()
  lazytest:toggle()
end

vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<C-t>", "<cmd>lua _lazytest_toggle()<CR>", {noremap = true, silent = true})
```

The above binds `<C-t>` to bring up a new floating terminal and executes the `./lazytest` command. You can quit the terminal by pressing `q`. Make sure you include this config to your `init.lua`.

## Inspiration & Similar Projects üí¨

LazyTest is heavily inspired by the following projects. Go check them out - their work is excellent!

* [LazyGit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) - A simple terminal UI for git commands
* [NeoTest](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest) - A framework for interacting with tests within NeoVim.
